## üåü Key Features

* **Dual Verification Methods:** Upload a certificate file (PDF, JPG, PNG) or enter a Certificate ID directly.
* **AI-Powered Forgery Detection:** Simulates analysis of document properties to generate a "Tamper Score," flagging potential forgeries.
* **Instant Results:** Get clear, actionable verification statuses‚Äî`Valid`, `Invalid (Fake)`, or `Suspect`.
* **‚ú® Gemini AI Anomaly Reports:** For 'Suspect' certificates, users can generate a detailed report from the Gemini API, outlining potential reasons for the flag (e.g., font inconsistencies, signature mismatch).
* **‚ú® Gemini AI Support Tickets:** A built-in support form allows users to get AI assistance in drafting professional, detailed support tickets from a simple query.
* **Verification History:** Keeps a session-based log of all verification activities for easy reference.
* **Secure & Responsive UI:** A clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly on all devices.
* **SPA Architecture:** A fast single-page application experience built with vanilla JavaScript, without the need for a heavy framework.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a simulated but logically sound verification process:

1.  **Upload & Preprocessing:** A user uploads a certificate file or enters an ID. The system prepares the input for analysis.
2.  **OCR & Data Extraction (Simulated):** In a real-world scenario, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) would extract key fields like Name, Course, and Certificate ID.
3.  **Database Matching (Simulated):** The extracted data is cross-referenced with a secure institutional database. A mismatch results in an "Invalid" status.
4.  **Forgery Detection & Tamper Score:** The system analyzes various markers (simulated) to calculate a weighted "Tamper Score". A high score on a matched certificate results in a "Suspect" status.
5.  **AI Analysis:** If a certificate is "Suspect," a call is made to the **Gemini API** with a prompt containing the certificate's context, requesting an analysis of potential anomalies.
6.  **Results Display:** A comprehensive report is presented to the user with all the relevant details and AI-generated insights.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser.
* A code editor (e.g., VS Code with the "Live Server" extension is recommended for easy local hosting).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: API Key Configuration

This project uses the Google Gemini API, which requires a secret API key. **Never expose your API key in the client-side JavaScript code.**

1.  **Obtain API Key:** Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).

2.  **Set up a Backend Proxy:** The only secure way to use an API key is through a backend server that acts as a proxy. Your frontend will call your backend, and your backend will securely add the key and call the Google API.

3.  **Local Configuration (if using a backend):**
    * Create a file named `.env` in your backend's root directory.
    * Add your API key to this file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    * Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes `.env` to prevent the key from being committed to Git.
        ```
        # .gitignore
        .env
        ```

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/smart-certificate-verifier.git](https://github.com/your-username/smart-certificate-verifier.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd smart-certificate-verifier
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    * If you have the "Live Server" extension in VS Code, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    * Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.
